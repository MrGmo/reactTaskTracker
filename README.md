#react-task-tracker

Hi there!

This repo contains a simple task tracker app. This was one of my first React projects made by watching the following Traversy Media tutorial:

How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

I built this app a while ago, but I'm just now getting around to writing a read-me file for it. This project gave me a good introduction to React which included components, props, state, hooks, and even working with an API.

Possible Improvements:

If I had a bit more time I would have added a bit more functionality to the UI and deployed it to netlify or heroku.

Lessons Learned:

Learned the three most important elements of React: components, props, and state.

Also learned how to link a React front end to a dummy server for production purposes.

Here's a couple more projects I've built:
